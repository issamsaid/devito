Devito - Fast Finite Difference Computation
===========================================

Devito is a new tool for performing optimised Finite Difference (FD)
computation from high-level symbolic problem definitions. Devito performs
automated code generation and Just-In-time (JIT) compilation based on symbolic
equations defined in `SymPy <http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html>`_ to create
and execute highly optimised Finite Difference kernels on multiple computer
platforms.

Devito is also intended to provide the driving operator kernels for a prototype
Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) code that can be found 
`here <https://github.com/opesci/inversion>`_.
